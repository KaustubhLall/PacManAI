# PacManAI

Welcome to PacManAI, where the timeless arcade classic meets modern artificial intelligence. My project is at the forefront of developing sophisticated AI agents capable of navigating the mazes and challenges of Pac-Man with unparalleled strategy and skill.

## Features

- **Multiple AI Agents**: Offering a variety of AI players, each equipped with unique strategies and learning capabilities.
- **NEAT Configurations**: Utilizing NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) to evolve adaptive neural networks for gameplay.
- **Advanced Learning Models**: Incorporating cutting-edge deep reinforcement learning techniques such as DQN and CoDeepNEAT.
- **Modular Design**: Our codebase is designed for extensibility, allowing for the easy integration of new AI models and gaming environments.
- **Replay and Analysis**: Save and review gameplay to analyze AI behavior and strategy evolution.
