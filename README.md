Currently under development.

Provides multiple agents to play PacMan.

To install depecdencies, run pip install -r requirements.txt after cloning.

Then, run the desired AI agent from within each module in the ai/ folder.

The modules do not have a current standardized interface - for example a DQN requires the gamestate in a different way than a CoDeepNEAT environment, and for reasearch each implementation is provided seperately but uses the same game class to run.
